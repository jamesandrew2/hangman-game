Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game, a simple yet fun web-based game built with React. This project showcases a modern implementation of the classic word guessing game where you attempt to figure out a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. Be careful, though! Too many incorrect guesses, and the hangman gets drawn piece by piece.

Features

Interactive Gameplay: Click to guess letters and try to solve the word. Dynamic Word Generation: Words are randomly selected from a predefined list, ensuring a new challenge each time. Visual Feedback: Watch as the hangman is drawn progressively with each incorrect guess. Images are used to represent the hangmanâ€™s stages. Responsive Design: Play the game on any device, with a UI that adjusts to screen size for optimal gameplay. Game Restart: Easily restart the game at any time to try a different word. Installation
